# 编译语言

*Move* 和 *Solidity* 都是编译型编程语言，但它们之间存在一些差异。

Move 是 Facebook 开发的一种静态类型语言。它强调安全和保障，具有资源所有权和借用等特征，并针对效率和低 gas 费用进行了优化。Move 的编译器生成在 Move 虚拟机上执行的字节码。

另一方面，Solidity 是一种面向合约的高级编程语言，用于在以太坊区块链上编写智能合约。它也是静态类型和编译的，但它也有一些动态特性。Solidity 的编译器生成在以太坊虚拟机（EVM）上执行的字节码。

Move 和 Solidity 在语法和结构上有相似之处，但它们针对不同的区块链和用例进行了优化。就编译过程而言，两种语言都需要一个编译步骤，然后才能在各自区块链的虚拟机上执行。

<!-- # Compiled language

_Move_ and _Solidity_ are both compiled programming languages, but there are some differences between them.

Move is a statically-typed language developed by Facebook. It emphasizes safety and security, with features such as resource ownership and borrowing, and it is optimized for efficiency and low gas fees. Move's compiler generates bytecode that is executed on the Move Virtual Machine.

Solidity, on the other hand, is a contract-oriented, high-level programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is also statically-typed and compiled, but it has some dynamic features as well. Solidity's compiler generates bytecode that is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Both Move and Solidity share similarities in their syntax and structure, but they are optimized for different blockchains and use cases. In terms of their compilation process, both languages require a compilation step before they can be executed on their respective blockchain's virtual machine. -->
