# 智能合约验证

Move 的设计重点是安全性，该语言本身有几个内置功能可以帮助进行验证。Move 有一个正式的验证系统，允许开发人员从数学上证明他们的代码是正确的并且没有错误。这是通过 Move 的线性类型系统实现的，这使得推断代码正确性变得更加容易，并消除了许多常见的漏洞，例如重入攻击。

另一方面，Solidity 传统上因其缺乏安全功能和难以验证合约的正确性而受到批评。然而，近年来，随着正式验证框架（如 VeriSol）、静态分析器和帮助检测常见漏洞的 linters 等工具的引入，Solidity 生态系统有了重大改进。

总的来说，虽然这两种语言都提供了用于智能合约验证的工具，但 Move 内置的形式验证和安全性功能使其更适合优先考虑智能合约安全性和正确性的开发人员。另一方面，Solidity 近年来取得了重大进展，也是借助外部工具和框架进行智能合约开发的可行选择。

<!-- # Smart contract verification

Move was designed with a focus on security, and the language itself has several built-in features to help with verification. Move has a formal verification system that allows developers to mathematically prove that their code is correct and free from bugs. This is accomplished through Move's linear type system, which makes it easier to reason about code correctness and eliminates many common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks.

Solidity, on the other hand, has traditionally been criticized for its lack of security features and the difficulty in verifying contracts for correctness. However, in recent years, there have been significant improvements in the Solidity ecosystem, with the introduction of tools like formal verification frameworks (such as VeriSol), static analyzers, and linters that help detect common vulnerabilities.

Overall, while both languages offer tools for smart contract verification, Move's built-in features for formal verification and security make it a more suitable choice for developers who prioritize security and correctness in their smart contracts. Solidity, on the other hand, has made significant progress in recent years and is also a viable option for smart contract development with the help of external tools and frameworks. -->
